# Parker - Parking Reservation System

This application was developed to address the need for a streamlined reservation process for two parking spots within my housing association, ensuring efficient and fair access for all residents.

## Tech Stack:

- SvelteKit / JavaScript / TypeScript
- Airtable

## Features

- Make a Reservation: Allows users to easily book a parking spot.
- View Next Reservation: Enables users to see upcoming reservations for each parking spot.
- Delete Reservations: Provides an option to cancel reservations when plans change.
- Toggle Calendar Views: Switch between different calendar layouts for better date visibility.
- Reservation Logic: Ensures only two people can reserve a spot at any given time, preventing double bookings.
